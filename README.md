## Scenario:
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

#### Business Task:
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- Analyse how annual members and causal riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and provide data-driven recommendations for a new marketing strategy to convert causal riders to members

#### Key Stakeholders:
- **Lily Monero**: Director of Marketing and my manager
- **Cyclistic Marketing analytics team**: Team of data analysts
- **Cyclists executive team**: Stakeholder approving recommendations

## Recommendations:
1. Advertise during **New Year's period** to convince casual riders to convert to members.
2. Encourage casual riders to sign up for membership to use bikes as **alternative mode of transportation**, for **health and environment.**
3. Introduce an **exclusive members' community** with members' only **bonding and relaxation events/activities.**

<br>

## Future Improvements:
- [ ] Collect survey data for analysis to better understand the decision-making mindset of casual riders vs members.
- [ ] A larger data set can be used for analyzing longer term trends and behaviors of riders.
- [ ] The start and end stations can be analyzed to see if there are any particular areas that have more members and find the reasons for such occurrences.
